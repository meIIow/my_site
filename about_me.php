			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>
				Last June, I graduated magna cum laude from Middlebury College with a double-major in Computer Science and Neuroscience.
				Middlebury is a top-tier liberal arts college in central Vermont – check out its campus in the background! 
				That’s me in the middle, juggling a soccer ball.
				<br>
				I also completed all pre-med requirements and spent a semester abroad at University of Sydney.

			<h2>Entertainment and Music</h2>
			<p>
				I’ve loved to read since I was a kid.
				I stick mostly to fiction, especially sci-fi and fantasy, although I also like to read about AI and biology.
				I’m a fan of John Irving and Neil Gaiman, and have recently gotten into Murakami.
				<br>
				Music is one of my biggest sources of inspiration – it can energize you, remind you of old times, or put you in a certain mindset.
				The only instrument I play is the piano (poorly), but I’m quite good at listening to music.
				I like a solid variety of genres, but my favorite stuff is generally indie-rock, especially if it’s upbeat with silly lyrics.
				I’m a huge fan of Vampire Weekend and bands of their ilk, but also have a soft spot for classic rock and 80s pop.
				<br>
				I also like getting together with my friends to play board, video, or card games – I really enjoy forming a strategy and seeing if it pays off.
				I’m also a fan of riddles and puzzles, or really anything that forces me to think in new ways.

			<h2>Who I Am</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Max – an aspiring software engineer and science enthusiast living in Los Angeles, CA. 
				This page is full of info on my background and hobbies, but I encourage you to click
				here
				to learn more about my academic and intellectual interests! 
				I think they say a lot about what motivates me and how I think about the world.

			<h2>Outdoor Activities</h2>
			<p>
				I maintain a fairly active lifestyle – I run a few times a week and am currently on a bodyweight fitness kick.
				I was on the track and cross country teams, so running has been a big part of my life for a while.
				I think it’s a great way to carve out some time to clear your head or mull things over while doing something productive.
				<br>
				With that said, my favorite thing to do outside is play sports – I think exercise is way more fun when it’s a game. 
				I especially love soccer, which I’ve been playing almost my whole life, but I’m happy to join a pickup game of any sort.
				<br>
				I also like to hike and snowboard, although I’m prone to wiping out when I do the latter.
