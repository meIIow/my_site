					<h2><a href ="http://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a></h2>
					<p>
						My go-to site for statistics-driven perspectives on all sorts of current events, from sports to pop culture to politics.
						Election coverage is their claim to fame, but there’s a lot to love here - one of my favorite columns is their weekly Riddler puzzler.
					</p>

					<h2><a href ="http://nautil.us">Nautilus</a></h2>
					<p>
						Nautilus might be one of the newer scientific magazines out there, but I think it’s also one of the best.
						It’s great for getting your fix of science news, and tends to provide comprehensive, multi-faceted views on any given topic.

					<h2><a href="http://theonion.com">The Onion</a></h2>
					<p>
						This is probably the funniest site on the internet.
						They somehow manage to capture a thought we didn’t realize we had and turn it on its head. They just get it.
					</p>

					<h2><a href="http://ted.com">Ted.com</a></h2>
					<p>
						Everyone knows about Ted Talks, but I think people forget just how awesome these lectures are.
						You can learn about practically anything that interests you.
						It’s like cat videos for the curious mind. You’ll wonder where the time went.

					<h2><a href="http://world.time.com/timelapse/">TIME's Timelapse</a></h2>
					<p>
						See for yourself how climate change and urban development have changed the face of our planet, and learn a ton in the process.
						It’s a cool lesson in how we impact the environment, and how a well-made visualization can make a powerful point.
					</p>

				<div class ="infoBox">
					<h2><a href ="http://politifact.com">PolitiFact</a></h2>
					<p>
						In a partisan age, I think it’s important to accept the valid parts of opposing viewpoints
						and acknowledge that not everything that reinforces your opinions is right.
						That’s a necessary part of being an informed, open-minded person with real convictions.
						And that’s why PolitiFact exists.
