				I’m currently working on an event-finder web application that utilize the MEAN software stack.
				It will be a place to search for local events that have either been posted by other users
				or extracted from Facebook using their API, from pickup sports to festivals and concerts.
				I think that an app like this could be really awesome for someone who's looking to join
				a basketball game or wants something to do with their friends on the weekend, although
				its bigger purpose is to teach me more about web development.
				<br><br>
				So far, it’s been a great way to learn about these frameworks and practice integrating
				and using external APIs. My only experience with Angular up until now was through online tutorials,
				so this application has been a great way to explore it on my own terms.
