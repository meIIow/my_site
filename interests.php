				I’m broadly interested in biology and technology, which I see as inexorably linked.
				New tech enables scientific discovery, which can then inspire the next generation of computer science innovation.
				I am especially drawn towards genetics, neuroscience, and medicine – three disciplines on the forefront of this interplay –
				and find that approaching these fields from a computer science perspective generates some of the most important questions.
				<br><br>
				How can DNA encode the insane complexity of life?
				How has evolution engineered a self-sustaining system from biochemical building blocks?
				How do disease and injury throw off the delicate balance of our internal programing,
				and how can the resulting chain-reaction of issues be resolved?
				<br><br>
				And the question I find most mystifying: how does the brain work?
				It can extract meaning from external stimuli to create a real-time perception of the outside world.
				It can store and retrieve information as memories, language, concepts, and more.
				And most impressively, it can think in abstract terms, enabling the novel insights and connections that we think of as true ingenuity.
				<br><br>
				These functions all relate to the most exciting field of all: artificial intelligence.
				I love to learn about the clever ways we’ve been able to deconstruct complicated behaviors into underlying strategies,
				especially through tools that draw on our knowledge of biological processes, like neural nets and genetic algorithms.
				I’m hopeful that eventually we’ll turn our focus towards capturing the robustness of the human brain, and graduate from asking
				“How do we solve this problem?” to “How do we solve problems?”.
				<br><br>
				I think that my appetite for new ways of thinking is the thread that ties these interests together.
				Ultimately, I enjoy any task that allows me to develop new skills, learn new tools, and find efficient solutions to complex problems.
