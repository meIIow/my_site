				My first foray into mobile development has been a shuttle-run timer, which I’m still finishing up.
				What's a shuttle-run? It's a brutal fitness test that soccer programs often use to assess speed
				and stamina. Basically you run an interval at a pace that increases every few completions - the
				goal is to keep finishing in time for as long as you can. My uncle wants an app that lets him
				control the starting speed so he can torture my cousin.
				<br><br>
				I’m developing it exclusively for Android right now, which has given me more practice writing flexible Java code
				and taught me a fair amount of XML.
				<br><br>
				I think it’s an awesome first project to tackle - the interface and functionality are relatively simple
				so I can focus on learning new development tools, but if I want to add more complexity when I'm done
				I can update it with more fitness-timing features.
